The petals range from deep obsidian to rich chocolate and black cherry and burst forth from deep onyx centers like a supernova. Some blooms have a vibrant yellow ring, or corona, around the pollen disk, just to add extra depth! This multi-branching variety stands 6-7 feet in height and the heads average 5-8 inches across. This is a top choice for garden design or cut flower sales thanks to a long vase life and lower pollen count than other heirloom sunflowers.'
